# TODOs/ideas

## JSON Schema

* TypeScript-typings for the JSON XMI format.
  Could use [json-schema-to-typescript](https://github.com/bcherny/json-schema-to-typescript) for that.
* A [Jackson-binding for JSON Schema](https://github.com/mbknor/mbknor-jackson-jsonSchema).
* Validate on the CLI.

## Ecore + XMI

* A mapping that maps an Ecore to _precise_ XML and JSON Schemas: _descent_.
* A (standalone) Web editor for Ecore.
* &hellip; Implementations of Ecore (and XMI, as generation target) in JetBrains' MPS.
* Use Xcore to conveniently author Ecore models outside of Eclipse.

## Other

* Make proper division, with documents separate.
* Set up a testing ground for EMF, using Maven.
    Use that to quickly generate example models, test, and experiment.
* Make EMF/Ecore-based services (validation, generation, etc.) available through AWS Lambda.
* Use [https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml-js) to read/write XMI to/from JSON.
